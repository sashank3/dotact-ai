            ## Installation

            ### Option 1: Using the Installer (Recommended)
            1. Download `keenplay_setup_${{ env.VERSION }}.exe`
            2. When your browser shows a security warning, click "Keep" or "Download anyway"
            3. This warning appears because we use a self-signed certificate rather than a purchased one
            4. The application is completely safe to use
            5. Run the installer and follow the instructions

            ### Option 2: Manual Installation
            1. Download `keenplay_files_${{ env.VERSION }}.zip`
            2. Extract the contents to a folder of your choice
            3. Run `keenplay.exe` to start the application

            ## About Security Warnings

            Windows SmartScreen may flag our installer because:
            - It's digitally signed with a self-signed certificate rather than a purchased one
            - Our application doesn't yet have a reputation built with Microsoft

            These warnings don't indicate any actual security issue with the software.
